        This Quran web app is a Sadaqah Jariyah. I hope to make it easy for
        everyone to read, study, and learn the Holy Quran. I do not serve you
        ads, so I do not need to track you or use your personal data to provide
        you with better ads. I don’t gather any personally identifiable
        information. There is no login, there is also no request for location
        permissions. I do use Google Analytics for ensuring that the site
        continues to work as expected and for knowing which features to
        prioritize working on. This information is anonymous and I can’t trace
        it back to any particular individual. My code is open source, so the
        community can easily inspect and ensure that our stance on privacy is
        being held to its upmost level.
